Stage all changes, generate a conventional commit message based on the diff, and commit.

1. Run `git add -A` to stage all changes
2. Run `git diff --cached --stat` to see what's staged
3. Generate a conventional commit message (feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:, refactor:, test:)
4. Commit with the generated message
5. Show the commit hash and message
